# Twenty-Nine Card Game

The Twenty-Nine card game is a South Asian trick-taking card game played with four players in two partnerships.

## Rules

### Objective
The objective is to win tricks that contain valuable cards. A trick is a hand in a trick-taking game where each player plays a single card.

### Cards
- The game uses only 32 cards from a standard 52-card deck.
- Each suit has 8 cards: J (high), 9, A, 10, K, Q, 8, and 7 (low).

### Card Values
- Jacks: 3 points
- Nines: 2 points
- Aces: 1 point
- Tens: 1 point
- K, Q, 8, 7: 0 points
- Total points in the deck: 28 points

### Bidding Phase
- Players bid to determine the trump suit and target score.
- Bidding starts with the player to the left of the dealer and moves left.
- The highest bidder wins and selects the trump suit.
- The minimum bid is 16, and the maximum is 28. (Additional one point for the last hand)

### The Deal
- The dealer shuffles the deck and deals four cards to each player.
- Players place bids based on their cards.
- The winner of the bidding sets the trump suit.

### Game Play
- The first trick starts with the player to the left of the dealer.
- Players must follow suit if they can.
- The trump suit is initially unknown to all players.
- The first player unable to follow suit asks the bidder about the trump suit.
- The highest-value card of the declared trump suit wins the trick.

Note: The game is traditionally played with the 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s used as trump indicators. Each player receives cards from each suit, and sometimes the 6s are used for scoring.
